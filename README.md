# DHCP logger in nodejs
Really simple project to experiment with the dgram(UDP) package in nodejs and the DHCP protocol.

Logs all dhcp requests made on the network to console with some relevant request parameters.

### For a more fully featured DHCP package in nodejs see [this repo](https://github.com/infusion/node-dhcp)
This package is an implementation of the DHCP client AND server protocol with a lot of options for any use case.
